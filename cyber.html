        <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>Certainly! Here's a narrative version of the cybersecurity studying roadmap:
          <ul>
          <li>Embarking on a journey in cybersecurity starts with establishing a solid foundation in networking and systems. Understanding network protocols, architecture, and the basics of operating systems lays the groundwork for diving into cybersecurity concepts.</li>
          
          <li>Once the fundamentals are in place, delving into cybersecurity basics is crucial. Concepts like the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) become paramount, along with gaining insights into common threats, attack vectors, and defense strategies.</li>
          
          <li>Cryptography emerges as a pivotal area to explore, delving into cryptographic algorithms, keys, and protocols. Learning encryption techniques not only enhances data protection but also contributes to secure communication practices.</li>
          
          <li>Moving forward, acquiring skills in secure software development becomes imperative. This involves mastering secure coding practices, understanding threat modeling, and conducting risk assessments to fortify software against vulnerabilities.</li>
          
          <li>The realm of penetration testing and ethical hacking opens up avenues to test and fortify defenses. Developing expertise in penetration testing methodologies, utilizing ethical hacking tools, and identifying and remediating security weaknesses are key milestones in this phase.</li>
          
          <li>Network security becomes a focal point, encompassing firewall configurations, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPNs, secure protocols like SSL/TLS, and techniques for network hardening.</li> 
          
          <li>Web application security comes into focus, addressing common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and implementing secure coding practices for web applications and APIs.</li>
          
          <li>With the shift towards cloud computing, understanding cloud security principles, architectures, shared responsibility models, and identity/access management strategies becomes essential.</li>
          
          <li>Preparing for incidents and forensics is another critical aspect. Acquiring skills in incident response, forensic analysis, evidence collection, and understanding incident response frameworks and legal considerations prepares one for handling security incidents effectively.</li>
          
          <li>Security governance and compliance round out the roadmap, involving knowledge of cybersecurity governance frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO/IEC 27001), compliance requirements, regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), risk management strategies, and ensuring organizational adherence to security standards.</li>
          
          <li>Staying abreast of emerging technologies, their security implications, and engaging in continuous learning through certifications, conferences, workshops, and industry resources further enriches one's cybersecurity journey, ensuring relevance and proficiency in a rapidly evolving landscape.</p></li>
